## Changing the Hostname with a NETCONF EDIT Operation

Device configurations are made by performing NETCONF edit operations.  The only difference to the GET operations is that instead of passing a _filter_ to query data, you use an XML string (or object), to configure the device.  In both cases, the XML data must adhere to the YANG model. Using the tree visualization produced by `pyang`, we will now write a a script to modify the hostname of both switches. 


Once again, looking at the saved file `/tmp/nxos_native.txt`, we find:

``` shell
module: Cisco-NX-OS-device
    +--rw System
       +--rw id?                         uint32
       +--ro mode?                       top_Mode
       +--rw address?                    address_Ipv4
       +--ro oobMgmtAddr?                address_Ipv4
       +--ro inbMgmtAddr?                address_Ipv4
       +--rw role?                       top_NodeRole
       +--ro currentTime?                uint64
       +--ro systemUpTime?               uint64
       +--ro serial?                     eqpt_Serial
       +--ro podId?                      top_PodId
       +--ro fabricId?                   top_FabricId
       +--ro fabricMAC?                  top_fabricMacAddr
       +--ro state?                      top_SystemSt
       +--ro configIssues?               top_ConfigIssues
       +--rw name?                       naming_Name

```

The "read-write" leaf called `name` directly under the `System` root represents the hostname of the device. Now we can model the filter to update the hostname as:


``` python
new_name = """
    <config>
      <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
        <name>nxos-spine1</name>
      </System>
    </config>
    """
```

> Note: all configuration objects are going to be encompassed within the `<config>` and `</config>` tags.

In the sample code directory `01-yang`, execute the `update_hostname.py` script. 

> This script uses the XML string, to update the hostname of the `nx-osv9000-1` device to `nxos-spine1`:


``` 
(python2) [root@localhost 01-yang]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/learning_labs/yang/01-yang
(python2) [root@localhost 01-yang]# python update_hostname.py 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rpc-reply xmlns:if="http://www.cisco.com/nxos:1.0:if_manager" xmlns:nfcli="http://www.cisco.com/nxos:1.0:nfcli" xmlns:nxos="http://www.cisco.com/nxos:1.0" xmlns:vlan_mgr_cli="http://www.cisco.com/nxos:1.0:vlan_mgr_cli" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="urn:uuid:2637d9ec-b8c6-46f8-9ebc-c96134ba5258">
    <ok/>
</rpc-reply>
(python2) [root@localhost 01-yang]#
```

You should receive the "OK" response back from the device. 

Validate the changes by logging into the devices and verifying:

```

(python2) [root@localhost 01-yang]# ssh admin@172.16.30.101

nxos-spine1# show hostname

```

Go ahead and manually reset it back to the original name:

``` shell
nxos-spine1# conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
nxos-spine1(config)# hostname nx-osv9000-1
nx-osv9000-1(config)# exit
nx-osv9000-1# show hostname 
nx-osv9000-1
