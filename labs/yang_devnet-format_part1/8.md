## Adding a Loopback Interface with an EDIT Operation

In the previous sections we performed NETCONF operations on YANG leaf nodes that were relatively straightforward to visualize from the data model. In this section, we will add a loopback interface on each switch, once again, leveraging the Cisco NXOS YANG model.

To help focus on the YANG model definitions for the interfaces and loopback interfaces in particular, it will be helpful to narrow down the visualization of the data model to just the relevant elements in the model.

> For our example, we will be adding a new loopback address and assigning an IP address to the interface.

The YANG model for the Nexus models the interface, distinctly from the IP address assignment to that interface, as you'll soon see.

1. From a bash terminal, navigate to the to the `nxos-code/yang/01-yang` directory within the cloned repository.
1. First, let's check the current loopbacks on the device.  Execute this command and view the results.  

    ```python
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ python get_loopbacks.py
    The following loopbacks exist on the switch.
      Loopback lo1
    The following loopbacks have IP addresses assigned.
      Loopback lo1 with IP 172.16.0.1/32
          
    # Your resulting list may differ
    ```

1. Pick a new Loopback Id and IP address not currently in use.  In this example we will use `lo99` and IP `10.99.99.1/24` but be sure to one that is NOT in use already. 
1. Execute the `pyang` command with a specific `tree-path` to collect the YANG definition for loopback interface and write to a file. 

    ```python
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ pyang -f tree --tree-path="/System/intf-items/lb-items"  Cisco-NX-OS-device.yang  -o nxos_lbintf.txt
    
    # output omitted
    ```

    > Note: these pyang commands can take a minute to complete.

1. Next, collect the YANG definition for IP addressing an interface from the NXOS YANG model.

    ```python
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ pyang -f tree --tree-path="/System/ipv4-items/inst-items/dom-items/Dom-list/if-items/If-list"  Cisco-NX-OS-device.yang  -o nxos_ipv4.txt
    ```

1. Let's look at the model definition for the interfaces. Open up the `nxos_lbintf.txt` file using a text editor.

    ``` shell
    module: Cisco-NX-OS-device
        +--rw System
           +--rw intf-items
              +--rw lb-items
                 +--rw LbRtdIf-list* [id]
                    +--rw linkLog?                       l1_LinkLog
                    +--rw name?                          naming_Name
                    +--rw id                             nw_IfId
                    +--rw descr?                         naming_Descr
                    +--rw adminSt?                       l1_AdminSt
                    +--rw vrf-items
                    |  +--ro name?   l3_VrfName
                    +--rw lbrtdif-items
                    |  +--ro ifIndex?        uint32
                    |  +--ro iod?            uint64
    ...
    ```
    
    > Above output is shortened to focus on the lab specifics.
    
1. Studying this model, we can identify the nodes that are needed (to construct the XML string) to add a new loopback interface. Walking the path in this tree we can get to the `loopback id`, `admin state`  and `description` as follows:

    ``` shell
    /System/intf-items/lb-items/LbRtdIf-list/id
    /System/intf-items/lb-items/LbRtdIf-list/adminSt
    /System/intf-items/lb-items/LbRtdIf-list/descr
    
    ```

1. Use this information to build out our configuration XML string. Open `add_loopbacks.py` in a text editor to view and update this code snippet. 
    > Note: Before executing the command, be sure to update with an unused loopback info.
    
    ```python
    # Loopback Info - Change the details for your interface
    loopback = {"id": "99", "ip": "10.99.99.1/24"}
    .
    .
    loopback_add = """
    <config>
        <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
            <intf-items>
                <lb-items>
                    <LbRtdIf-list>
                        <id>lo{}</id>
                        <adminSt>up</adminSt>
                        <descr>Interface added via NETCONF</descr>
                    </LbRtdIf-list>
                </lb-items>
            </intf-items>
        </System>
    </config>""".format(loopback["id"])
    ```

    > Note: Here only the loopback is being created, the IP isn't assigned in this operation.

1. Now execute the `add_loopbacks.py` script.

    ```
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ python add_loopbacks.py
    
    Now adding Loopback99 device sbx-nxos-mgmt.cisco.com...
    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <rpc-reply message-id="urn:uuid:30b02bad-c1f1-4951-ae76-ab8135ff71f8" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
        <ok/>
    </rpc-reply>
    ```
1. Now verify that the loopback was created by re-running `get_loopbacks.py`

    ``` shell
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ python get_loopbacks.py
    The following loopbacks exist on the switch.
      Loopback lo1
      Loopback lo99
    The following loopbacks have IP addresses assigned.
      Loopback lo1 with IP 172.16.0.1/32
    ```

1. As you can see the interface was created, but there is no IP address assigned.
1. *Alternatively you can SSH into the switch to verify.* 
1. The IP address definition is modeled in the NXOS YANG module under the `/System/ipv4-items` branch. In the previous step, we had created the visualization of the branch in the `nxos_ipv4.txt` file.  Let's go ahead and look at it using a text editor.

                             |     +--rw vpcPeer?      address_Ip
    
    ```

    > Note: An abbreviated version is presented above, to highlight the relevant configuration information for this lab

1. Analyzing this model, we can identify the nodes that need to be included within our XML string, to add a new IP address.
1. This model uses: `/System/ipv4-items/inst-items/dom-items/Dom-list/if-items/If-list/id` to identify the loopback interface, whose IP configuration needs to be changed. 
1. The node used to make the change to the IP address itself is given by the path: `/System/ipv4-items/inst-items/dom-items/Dom-list/if-items/If-list/addr-items/Addr-list/addr`

1. Open `add_loopback_ip.py` to see how this is reflected in the configuration payload to be sent. 
    > Note: Before executing the command, be sure to update with an unused loopback info.

    ```python
