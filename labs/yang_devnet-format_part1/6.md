## Gathering Serial Numbers with a NETCONF GET Operation

1. We're now going to collect the serial number of the device using the filter we created above using a pre-built script called `get_serial.py` from the sample code directory `01-yang`.  
1. From a bash terminal, navigate to the to the `nxos-code/yang/01-yang` directory within the cloned repository.
1. Now execute the `get_serial.py` script.  You'll see the following (with changes in serial number):

    ```
    (venv) 01-yang\ $ python get_serial.py
    The serial number for sbx-nxos-mgmt.cisco.com is 9CNTS3XFTXY
    ```

1. Using nano or any other text editor open the `get_serial.py` file to understand the code:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from ncclient import manager
    import sys
    from lxml import etree
    
    # Add parent directory to path to allow importing common vars
    sys.path.append("..") # noqa
    from device_info import sbx_n9kv_ao as device # noqa
    
    # create a main() method
    def main():
        """
        Main method that prints netconf capabilities of remote device.
        """
        serial_number = """
        <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
        <serial/>
        </System>
        """
    
        with manager.connect(host = device["address"],
                             port = device["netconf_port"],
                             username = device["username"],
                             password = device["password"],
                             hostkey_verify = False) as m:
    
            # Collect the NETCONF response
            netconf_response = m.get(('subtree', serial_number))
            # Parse the XML and print the data
            xml_data = netconf_response.data_ele
            serial =  xml_data.find(".//{http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device}serial").text
    
            print("The serial number for {} is {}".format(device["address"], serial))
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(main())
    ```


1. **The key takeaway here is that, we are able to execute a simple get request (NETCONF GET operation) and collect the devices' serial numbers, by using a XML representation of the Cisco NXOS YANG model.**
