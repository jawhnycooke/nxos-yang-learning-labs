<p>Before beginning this lab on your workstation, you'll want to install a standard set of development applications, tools, and interfaces.  To learn more about what tools and what they offer, you can explore the <a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/dev-setup/dev-what/step/1">What is a Development Environment, and why do you need one?</a> Learning Lab.  </p>

<p>To assist you with getting setup, DevNet has created Learning Labs that walk through the installation on different platforms.  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/dev-setup/dev-win/step/1">Setting up your Windows workstation as a development environment</a></li>

<li><a href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/dev-setup/dev-mac/step/1">Setting up your MacOS workstation as a development environment</a></li>

<p>Now that your workstation is ready to go, the next step is to retrieve the code and install the lab specific requirements.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The code for this lab is available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/nxos-code">CiscoDevNet/nxos-code</a>.  </p></li>

<li><p>Open a bash terminal and change to the directory where you would like to clone the repository.  For example, a directory called <code>code/</code> under your <code>$HOME</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">cd ~/code
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Clone the repository and change into the new folder.  </p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/nxos-code
cd nxos-code
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Create a Python 3 virtual environment and activate it.  </p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash"># MacOS or Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash"># Windows git-bash
py -3 -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Install the lab requirements. </p>

<pre><code class="bash language-bash">pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Open Postman and import the Collection and Environment files located in the <code>postman/</code> sub-directory (if present).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alright, you should be all set and ready to start the lab!  </p>
