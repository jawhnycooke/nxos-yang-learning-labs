## Collecting the ASN and BGP Router ID

1. By reviewing the YANG model tree output in the last step, the ASN can be obtained via the following path:
    * `/System/bgp-items/inst-items/asn`
1. Thus, the XML string that'll act as a NETCONF filter to query the device for the ASN, can be represented as the following:

    ```
    asn_filter = """
    <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
        <bgp-items>
            <inst-items>
                <asn/>
            </inst-items>
        </bgp-items>
    </System>
    ```
1. Let's execute a script that'll query the device this info. 
1. From a bash terminal, navigate to the to the `nxos-code/yang/02-yang` directory within the cloned repository.
1. Open the script called `get_bgp_asn.py` in a text editor. Notice the similarities and differences from the scripts you've already seen.
1. Execute the `get_bgp_asn.py` script.

    ```
    (venv) 02-yang\ $ python get_bgp_asn.py
    The ASN number for sbx-nxos-mgmt.cisco.com is 65535
    ```

1. If you take another look at the tree output found in `/tmp/nxos_bgp.txt`, you'll see BGP router ID can be obtained via the following path:
    * `/System/bgp-items/inst-items/dom-items/Dom-list/rtrId`
1. Thus, the XML string that'll act as a NETCONF filter to query the device for the BGP router ID, can be represented as the following:

    ```
    bgp_rtrid_filter = """
    <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
        <bgp-items>
            <inst-items>
                <dom-items>
                    <Dom-list>
                        <rtrId/>
                    </Dom-list>
                </dom-items>
            </inst-items>
        </bgp-items>
    </System>
    """
    ```

1. Open the script `get_bgp_rtrid.py` in a text editor. 
1. Execute the `get_bgp_rtrid.py` script.

    ```
    (venv) 02-yang\ $ python get_bgp_rtrid.py
    The BGP router-id for sbx-nxos-mgmt.cisco.com is 172.16.0.1
    ```
