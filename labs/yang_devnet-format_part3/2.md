## Exploring the use of OpenConfig YANG Models on Nexus

### Introduction to OpenConfig

The [OpenConfig](http://openconfig.net) Working Group, is a network operator driven working group focused on creating operationally relevant data models, now written in YANG. The resulting YANG models helps abstract vendor and platform dependencies. The models also allow for vendors to *augment* OpenConfig models with vendor/platform specific ones. So if operators are leveraging vendor specific features within a technology, that is still possible.

An OpenConfig (OC) BGP model implementation on a Cisco IOS XE device would be identical to an OpenConfig BGP model on a Cisco Nexus switch, for example.  Moreover, an OC model for others would be identical as well!

A major advantage of using vendor neutral models such as those from the OpenConfig Working Group is realized in the tooling used to automate devices.  Using neutral models operators can use the same tools/programs to more easily interface with various types of devices and platforms.

### Getting Started with OpenConfig Models on Nexus Switches

In order to explore and work with the OpenConfig implementation on the Nexus platform, the models need to be installed on the switch.  The DevNet Sandbox has had the models already installed, and in [Part 1](/modules/netconf-yang-nexus/yang_devnet-format_part1/step/2) you learned how to install them on your own device.
