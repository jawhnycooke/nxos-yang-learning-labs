## Exploring the use of OpenConfig YANG Models on Nexus

### Introduction to OpenConfig

The [OpenConfig](http://openconfig.net) Working Group, is a network operator driven working group focused on creating operationally relevant data models, now written in YANG. The resulting YANG models helps abstract vendor and platform dependencies. The models also allow for vendors to *augment* OpenConfig models with vendor/platform specific ones. So if operators are leveraging vendor specific features within a technology, that is still possible. 

An OpenConfig (OC) BGP model implementation on a Cisco IOS XE device would be identical to an OpenConfig BGP model on a Cisco Nexus switch, for example.  Moreover, an OC model for others would be identical as well!

A major advantage of using vendor neutral models such as those from the OpenConfig Working Group is realized in the tooling used to automate devices.  Using neutral models operators can use the same tools/programs to more easily interface with various types of devices and platforms.

### Getting Started with OpenConfig Models on Nexus Switches

In order to explore and work with the OpenConfig implementation on the Nexus platform we will need to install the necessary packages.

In Part 1, we installed three (3) `mtx` RPMs on the spine switches to deploy the Cisco specific NXOS YANG model and the NETCONF agent. 

Log into either of the spine switches to validate this:

``` shell
nx-osv9000-1# run bash sudo su
bash-4.2# yum list installed | grep mtx
mtx-device.x86_64                      1.0.0-r1705191346              @/mtx-device-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705191346.x86_64
mtx-infra.x86_64                       1.0.0-r1705191346              @/mtx-infra-1.0.0-r1705191346.x86_64
mtx-netconf-agent.x86_64               1.0.1-r1705191346              @/mtx-netconf-agent-1.0.1-r1705191346.x86_64
bash-4.2# 

```

In this part, we're going install OpenConfig models on both of the **leaf** switches. We will continue using the NETCONF agent on the switch as the interface to interact with the models.

For this exercise, we will install the following packages on the leaf devices:

``` 
mtx-infra-1.0.0-r1705191346.x86_64.rpm
mtx-device-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705191346.x86_64.rpm
mtx-netconf-agent-1.0.1-r1705191346.x86_64.rpm
mtx-openconfig-bgp-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705170158.x86_64.rpm 
mtx-openconfig-if-ip-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705170202.x86_64.rpm 
mtx-openconfig-interfaces-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705190423.x86_64.rpm
```

> Take note that there is a different file for each and every OpenConfig model supported on a device.  This is in contrast to a more monolithic device model such as the NXOS model we've been using thus far in Part 1 and the first half of Part 2.

Just like we saw in Part 1, these packages are freely available for download  at [the Cisco Nexus Artifactory](https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/open-nxos-agents/7.0-3-I6-1/x86_64/).

For the lab, these RPMs are downloaded and available in the `nxos_rpms` directory. Validate this by navigating to the directory and listing it:

``` 
(python2) [root@localhost ~]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/nxos_rpms/
(python2) [root@localhost nxos_rpms]# 
(python2) [root@localhost nxos_rpms]# ls -l

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  5505579 May 24 19:17 mtx-openconfig-interfaces-7_0_3_I6_1.1.0.0-r1705190423.x86_64.rpm
(python2) [root@localhost nxos_rpms]# 

```

Next copy the `mtx-infra-*`, `mtx-device-*`, `mtx-netconf-agent-*`, and OpenConfig models (`mtc-openconfig*`) to each leaf switch. 

Log into the leaf devices and execute the following copy commands:

```

```


The above shows the copy commands only for the **nx-osv9000-3** switch. 

You should now do this for **nx-osv9000-4**.
