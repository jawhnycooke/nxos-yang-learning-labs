#### Using the BGP OpenConfig Model

Earlier in this module, we learned how to use the Cisco NXOS YANG model to collect the ASN and BGP router if the devices. In this section, we will learn how to collect that same information through the OpenConfig model. 

As before, use the `pyang` utility, to build an understanding about the OpenConfig BGP model.

Navigate to the repository containing the YANG Nexus models:

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost 01-yang]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/yang/vendor/cisco/nx/7.0-3-I6-1/
(python2) [root@localhost 7.0-3-I6-1]# 

```

Execute `pyang` against the OpenConfig BGP YANG model:

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost 7.0-3-I6-1]# pyang -f tree openconfig-bgp.yang -o /tmp/nxos_oc_bgp.txt
(python2) [root@localhost 7.0-3-I6-1]# 

```

Open this file with a text editor:

``` shell
module: openconfig-bgp
    +--rw bgp!
       +--rw global
       |  +--rw config
       |  |  +--rw as           inet:as-number
       |  |  +--rw router-id?   yang:dotted-quad
       |  +--ro state
       |  |  +--ro as                inet:as-number
       |  |  +--ro router-id?        yang:dotted-quad
       |  |  +--ro total-paths?      uint32
       |  |  +--ro total-prefixes?   uint32
       |  +--rw route-selection-options
       |  |  +--rw config
       |  |  |  +--rw always-compare-med?           boolean
       |  |  |  +--rw ignore-as-path-length?        boolean
       |  |  |  +--rw external-compare-router-id?   boolean
       |  |  |  +--rw advertise-inactive-routes?    boolean

```


From this model, we can see that the ASN and the router ID are part of the `global` tree. Also we can see that there are two YANG containers that differentiate the configuration data versus the current state date. 

The `config` container nodes are `rw` whereas the `state` nodes are `ro`. 

Using this model, we can construct an XML filter to gather the data we are interested in:

``` xml
get_oc_bgp = """
<bgp xmlns="http://openconfig.net/yang/bgp">
    <global>
        <state/>
    </global>
</bgp>
"""        
```

Navigate to the sample code directory `03-yang`. This contains a Python script that uses the filter above and collects the ASN and router id information from **nx-osv9000-3** and **nx-osv9000-4**.

Navigate back to `03-yang`:

``` 
(python2) [root@localhost 7.0-3-I6-1]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/03-yang/
(python2) [root@localhost 03-yang]# 

```

Execute the `get_oc_bgp.py` script that uses the `get_oc_bgp` XML filter:

``` 
(python2) [root@localhost 03-yang]# python get_oc_bgp.py 
ASN number:65533, Router ID: 192.168.0.3 for (nx-osv9000-3) 172.16.30.103
ASN number:65534, Router ID: 192.168.0.4 for (nx-osv9000-4) 172.16.30.104
(python2) [root@localhost 03-yang]# 

```


## Conclusion

In Part 1, we built an understanding of the Cisco specific NXOS YANG model and used the model as a reference to retrieve and configure Nexus switches.  In Part 2, we explored the NXOS model further, specifically focusing on BGP. Finally, in Part 3, we introduced OpenConfig models and how they differ (in structure) from the NXOS model.  Note that OpenConfig models are vendor-neutral and may not support all the vendor, or Nexus, specific features, but intends to satisfy the majority of operator use cases

In both cases, the YANG models (both native and OpenConfig) are evolving.  However, you should realize that you don't actually *work with* YANG models.  You simply need to ensure your XML strings or objects adhere to those given YANG models!
