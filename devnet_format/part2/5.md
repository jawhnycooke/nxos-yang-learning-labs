## Collecting the ASN and BGP Router ID

By reviewing the YANG model tree output above, the ASN can be obtained via the following path:

`/System/bgp-items/inst-items/asn`

Thus, the XML string that'll act as a NETCONF filter to query the device for the ASN, can be represented as the following:

```
asn_filter = """
<System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
    <bgp-items>
        <inst-items>
            <asn/>
        </inst-items>
    </bgp-items>
</System>

```

Let's execute a script that'll query the device for two of the Nexus switches.

First, navigate to the sample code directory for `02-yang` using the command `cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/02-yang`.  You'll see a script called `get_bgp_asn.py` in this directory.

Execute the `get_bgp_asn.py` script.

``` 
(python2) [root@localhost 02-yang]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/02-yang
(python2) [root@localhost 02-yang]# python get_bgp_asn.py 
The ASN number for (nx-osv9000-1) 172.16.30.101 is 65531
The ASN number for (nx-osv9000-2) 172.16.30.102 is 65532
(python2) [root@localhost 02-yang]# 

```


If you take another look at the tree output found in `/tmp/nxos_bgp.txt`, you'll see BGP router ID can be obtained via the following path:

`/System/bgp-items/inst-items/dom-items/Dom-list/rtrId`

Thus, the XML string that'll act as a NETCONF filter to query the device for the BGP router ID, can be represented as the following:

``` 
bgp_rtrid_filter = """
<System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
    <bgp-items>
        <inst-items>
            <dom-items>
                <Dom-list>
                    <rtrId/>
                </Dom-list>
            </dom-items>
        </inst-items>
    </bgp-items>
</System>
"""
```

To execute the script utilizing this filter, execute the `get_bgp_rtrid.py` script.

``` 
(python2) [root@localhost 02-yang]# python get_bgp_rtrid.py 
The BGP router-id for (nx-osv9000-1) 172.16.30.101 is 192.168.0.1
The BGP router-id for (nx-osv-9000-2) 172.16.30.102 is 192.168.0.2
(python2) [root@localhost 02-yang]# 

```
