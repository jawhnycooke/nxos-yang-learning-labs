## Preparing the Switches

**STOP:** You should ensure that the NXOS Sandbox lab is reserved before starting as it takes a few minutes to get started!

### Copying the Installation Packages to the Nexus Switches

In order to work with the data model, we will first need to install the necessary software on the devices. The software installation RPMs are available for download, for free, at
[the Cisco Artifactory](https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/open-nxos-agents/)
*Note: No CCO login required*

There are three types of RPM packages to be aware of:

- NX-OS Programmable Interface Infrastructure Components
- Common Model Components
- Agent Components

Let's take a look at each so you can better understand them.

The NX-OS Programmable Interface Infrastructure comprises of two Linux RPM packages:

- **mtx-infra** — This RPM is platform-independent.
- **mtx-device-model** — This RPM is platform-dependent and must be selected to match the installed NX-OS image at the time of Cisco Artifactory download.


Common Model component RPMs provides support for Openconfig and IETF defined models. In order to enable support for one or more desired Common Models, the associated Common Model component RPMs must be downloaded and installed. 

As with the Cisco specific model (**mtx-device-model**), Common Model components are also platform-dependent and must be selected to match the installed NX-OS image at the time of Cisco Artifactory download.  You'll install a given common model such as a OpenConfig (OC) BGP model should you want to use the OC model instead of the Cisco Nexus model.

Finally, three agent packages are available: NETCONF, RESTConf and gRPC. At least one agent must be installed in order to have access to the modeled NX-OS interface. For our lab, we will be working with the NETCONF agent exclusively.


Login to the devbox to download the necessary packages. Run the following ansible playbook from the `yang-prereqs` directory:

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost sbx_nxos]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/yang-prereqs
(python2) [root@localhost yang-prereqs]# ansible-playbook get_rpms.yml
