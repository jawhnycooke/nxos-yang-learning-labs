Within the `7.0-3-I6-1` directory, issue the following command: 

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost 7.0-3-I6-1]# pyang -f tree Cisco-NX-OS-device.yang -o /tmp/nxos_native.txt
# output omitted and shown below
```

This is going to print the "tree" output of the NXOS device model to a file stored in `/tmp/nxos_native.txt`.

Now open the file `/tmp/nxos_native.txt` using vi or nano. This output is a visualization of the NXOS YANG model for the NXOS device. 

You'll see based on the output that YANG models are hierarchical, and this particular model is rooted in a container called `System`:

``` shell
module: Cisco-NX-OS-device
    +--rw System
       +--rw id?                         uint32
       +--ro mode?                       top_Mode
       +--rw address?                    address_Ipv4
       +--ro oobMgmtAddr?                address_Ipv4
       +--ro inbMgmtAddr?                address_Ipv4
       +--rw role?                       top_NodeRole
       +--ro currentTime?                uint64
       +--ro systemUpTime?               uint64
       +--ro serial?                     eqpt_Serial
       +--ro podId?                      top_PodId
       +--ro fabricId?                   top_FabricId
       +--ro fabricMAC?                  top_fabricMacAddr
       +--ro state?                      top_SystemSt
       +--ro configIssues?               top_ConfigIssues
       +--rw name?                       naming_Name
       +--rw bgp-items
p       |  +--rw name?         naming_Name
       |  +--rw adminSt?      nw_AdminSt
# output omitted for brevity
...
```

Let's now "use" this model and try and collect the serial number of the devices.  By using this model, it simply means we are going to pass an XML object to the device that adheres to this YANG model.

As we saw in the devnet learning lab for YANG, we can "interact" with this YANG model by constructing an equivalent `XML` filter and using that with the `ncclient` Python library over the NETCONF protocol.

Based on the tree output above, our `xml` filter would look like this

``` python
serial_number = """
    <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
      <serial/>
    </System>
    """
```

You could also have done the following:

``` python
serial_number = """
    <System xmlns="http://cisco.com/ns/yang/cisco-nx-os-device">
      <serial>
      </serial>
    </System>
    """
```


This follows the YANG tree, in that we are filtering for a YANG "leaf" node called `serial` that is rooted under the "container" `System`. 

*Note:The concepts of leafs and containers are explored in the YANG learning devnet lab.*

> YANG models can effectively be thought of as a documentation/definition, or _schema_, of a particular property of the device we are interested in interacting with.

Let's continue and actually make a request to the device.
