### Starting the NETCONF agent on the Nexus Switches

NETCONF is one of the 3 supported programmatic model-driven APIs available on the Nexus devices.  The agent installed in the last step will now act as a SSH sub-system that has the ability to leverage the models you also previously installed ![PII Architecture](images/PII_infra.jpg). 

On **nx-osv9000-1** and **nx-osv9000-2**, while still in the `bash` prompt execute the following command to start the NETCONF server (`netconfctl start`):

``` shell
bash-4.2# netconfctl start
Starting Netconf Agent: [OK]
bash-4.2# 
```

Now the NETCONF agent has been started, it will listen on TCP/830 on the switches even though it's still using SSH as its transport protocol.

> You need to start the netconf server only once. The server is automatically started for subsequent device reboots.

## Preparing the Control Machine (devbox)

The control machine (devbox) is where we will use a NETCONF client, allowing us to interact with the YANG models through the NETCONF agent interface. 

### The ncclient Python Library

[`ncclient`](https://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an opensource Python-based NETCONF client, that maps the XML-encoded nature of NETCONF to Python constructs and idioms, and vice versa.  It's the most popular and common way in Python to write scripts communicating with NETCONF-enabled devices.


### The pyang Python library

The [`pyang`](http://www.yang-central.org/twiki/pub/Main/YangTools/pyang.1.html) Python library is an opensource YANG validator and general tool to view and also convert models to different representations. 

We will use `pyang` as a learning tool to help visualize the YANG models for this lab.


### Installing the library files

We will now install `ncclient` and `pyang`. Navigate to the `yang-prereqs` directory

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost nxos_rpms]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/yang/yang-prereqs
(python2) [root@localhost yang-prereqs]#
```
Execute pip to install the requirements

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost yang-prereqs]# pip install -r yang-requirements.txt
