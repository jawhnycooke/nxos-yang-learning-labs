Next we'll install the Cisco NXOS device YANG model (that is platform dependent) on both **nx-osv9000-1** and **nx-osv9000-2**:

> For any given technology, more than one model can be installed on the device (as we will see, when we learn about OpenConfig YANG models in Part 3). Unique namespaces are used to distinguish the different installed models.  For example, you can install the OpenConfig BGP model and have the NXOS model that supports BGP installed at the same time.
